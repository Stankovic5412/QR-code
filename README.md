## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learnt a lot especially using flexbox to center the div. I realised that to center an element and add a background that takes just the right amount of space, you need to wrap the contents of that element in a div and give the background color property that you'd like to that div.


### Continued development
I hope to improve my ability to create responsive sites and web apps. To achieve this I need to lay my hands on more projects and play around with CSS grid, Flexbox and other properties. I also hope to improve my skills in frontend development and practise more with javascript.
